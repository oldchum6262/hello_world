<h2>A basic repository to test this new-fangled IT stuff out_____</h2>
<p style="color: red;">I've been <strong>supply teaching</strong> for the best part of the last 2 years. Before that, I was working in a warehouse with lots of <italic>loud conveyor</italic> belts running in the background.</p>
<p>I've <br/>been <ins>meaning</ins> to learn to code for a while but the stress of teaching, though the kids were likeable and never dull, prohibited new *information* from **being** absorbed and <u>assimilated</u>.</p> 
<p>I'm hoping that :coding: will lead to a ::career:: which has an introverted, thoughtful aspect to it compared with the extroverted processes that teaching 140+ kids a day requires.</p>
